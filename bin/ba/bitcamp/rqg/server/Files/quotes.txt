Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?
What so you want to know?
Well, hash is legal there, right?
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
Those are hash bars?
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause – get a load of this – if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.
You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
What?
It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.
Examples?
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.
What'd they call it?
Royale with Cheese.
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
What?
Mayonnaise.
Goddamn!
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.
Uuccch!
